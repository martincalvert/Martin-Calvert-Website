<h2>About Myself!</h2>
    Born and raised in Southern California, graduated from Woodcrest Christian High School in 2008. After high school I got a job at a screen printing shop, where I was first introduced to the pantone system and vector art, from there I started my schooling at Riverside Community College and decided I wanted to be a Computer Science Major. At RCC I took classes in Office, Dreamweaver, and Photoshop, on my way to a Associates in Science of Computer Information Systems. After of which I promptly transferred to Cal State San Bernardino to continue my studies in Computer Systems. I graduate with my Bachelor of Arts in Computer Systems with a Web Development option in June 2014. This degree is similar to a computer science degree but instead of physics classes it has art and communication classes, so this degree is catered more towards front-end or mid development. The most important thing I have learned in college, would be the ability to learn a topic in 10 weeks or less and be fully competent in it by then. </p>
          <p>I have been working on computers and their systems for the majority of my life, it is not just my field of study it is also a hobby which I love. So this is my passion in which I want to have a career in for the rest of my life. </p>
          <p>I have experience building hardware systems and networks for small business. I also have worked as a Webmaster for companies in the past, you can view these works on my <a href="works.php">portfolio page</a>. Other experience I have gained would be through school, I have been the team lead of many group projects which included topics such as database design & administration, iOS application development and system networking.
