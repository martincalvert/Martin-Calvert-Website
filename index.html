        <h2 id="aboutss">About Myself!</h2>
        <p>Born and raised in Southern California, graduated from Woodcrest Christian High School in 2008. After high school I got a job at a screen printing shop, where I was first introduced to the pantone system and vector art, from there I started my schooling at Riverside Community College and decided I wanted to be a Computer Science Major. At RCC I took classes in Office, Dreamweaver, and Photoshop, on my way to a Associates in Science of Computer Information Systems. After of which I promptly transferred to Cal State San Bernardino to continue my studies in Computer Systems. I graduate with my Bachelor of Arts in Computer Systems with a Web Development option in June 2014. This degree is similar to a computer science degree but instead of physics classes it has art and communication classes, so this degree is catered more towards front-end or mid development. The most important thing I have learned in college, would be the ability to learn a topic in 10 weeks or less and be fully competent in it by then. </p>
        <p>I have been working on computers and their systems for the majority of my life, it is not just my field of study it is also a hobby which I love. So this is my passion in which I want to have a career in for the rest of my life. </p>
        <p>I have experience building hardware systems and networks for small business. I also have worked as a Webmaster for companies in the past, you can view these works on my <a href="#works">portfolio page</a>. Other experience I have gained would be through school, I have been the team lead of many group projects which included topics such as database design & administration, iOS application development and system networking.

        <h1>Portfolio</h1>
        <p>For most of my portfolio work I will point you in the direction of my <a href="://github.com/sdla4ever">GitHub</a>. I also have a Stack Overflow and HackerRank. I have done work as a webmaster for many small companies, which included managing their websites, email accounts, databases, and building web apps.
        At Disney Interactive I have worked on numerous initiatives to improve the in house built CMS which runs on a stack that includes HA, Nginx, Mongo, and Ruby. During college I was the team leader for the majority of group projects I worked on and more than comfortable working as the source of information for a project and can easily provide myself self-motivation.
        I have worked on a multitude of consulting projects that included building backend web services, mobile applications, and network solutions. You can also catch some of my technical writings on my personal <a href="http://www.blog.martin-calvert.com">blog</a> or on <a href="http://www.adroitly.info">Adroitly.info</a> where my articles are also posted.</p>
